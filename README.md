# Final Projectâ€”_Sarcasm/Fake News Detector_

### Sarcasm Detector
For my final project, I would love to make a sarcasm detecting model. While doing my YouTube comments clustering project, I found it nearly impossible for my model to learn the relationship between sarcastic statements, and those which were not. I believe that if I were to train my model on a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic statements, it would be able to learn the relationships between the two, and later be able to classify new statements between the two.

Steps I would take to make this happen:
- Scrape tweets by @dril (and/or another sarcastic individual... maybe me), and by high-profile politicians, or others with a large, genuine feedâ€”one day
- See if any keywords spike in either group, show representations via matplotlibâ€”1 day or less
- Train a model on these tweets to learn the relationship between sarcastic and non-sarcastic discourseâ€”2-3 days
- Try the model on new statements, and see how accurate it isâ€”one day
- Get the model running via JSONâ€”1-2 days, play around with how it looks and actually make sure it fully works
- âœ¨hope my computer can detect sarcasm nowâœ¨â€”hopefully zero seconds

### Fake News Detector
I also considered training a fake news detecting model as well. I first thought about doing sarcasm as a general goal to beat, but then I thought about easily scraping tweets by @theonion (satirical news site) and @CNN or another respected news outlet, and training the model on the tweets from those. My steps would follow the ones listed above, but changing which data I am after, and what the model would be used for.

that's my proposal! ðŸ«¡
